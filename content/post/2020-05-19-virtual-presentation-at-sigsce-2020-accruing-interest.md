Unfortunately, the [SIGSCE](https://sigcse.org/sigcse/) (the Association for Computing Machinery's Special Interest Group on Computer Science Education) [2020 conference was cancelled](https://sigcse2020.sigcse.org/attendees/health-info.html). 

However, Alex Lishinski prepared a pre-precorded, virtual version of our lightning talk presentation, 
*Accruing Interest: What experiences contribute to students developing a sustained interest in computer science over time?*. That presentation is available from YouTube here:

The presentation is related to our PICSUL project, about which you can find more here: http://picsul.utk.edu/
