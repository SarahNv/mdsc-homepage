abstract: 'The existing work on teacher-focused Twitter hashtags typically frames each hashtag as a
single, unified phenomenon, thereby collapsing or erasing differences between them (and any
resulting implications for learning). In this study, we conceived of teacher-focused hashtags as
affinity spaces potentially containing subspaces distinguished by synchronous chats and other,
asynchronous communication. We used computational methods to explore how participation
differed in terms of content, interactions, and portals between these contexts within the #michED
hashtag used by Michigan teachers. During the 2015-2016 academic year, #michED saw more
non-chat activity than chat activity, and most participants only engaged in one mode of activity
or the other. Participation during chats was associated with more replying as well as more
socially-, affectively-, and cognitively-related content, suggesting a focus on social interaction.
In contrast, non-chat participation was associated with more retweeting, mentioning, hyperlinks,
and hashtags, suggesting a focus on content dissemination. These results suggest that different
affinity spaces—and different literacy practices—may exist within the same hashtag to support
different objectives. Teachers, teacher educators, and researchers should therefore be careful to
make these distinctions when considering Twitter as a learning technology for teachers.'
